            <p className="text-lg">
              We're specialists, not generalists. After running successful campaigns for fitness brands, e-commerce stores, and online learning platforms, we've developed expertise that generic marketing partners simply can't match.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Your metrics drive our strategy. Forget vanity metrics like ROAS and CPA that look good in reports but fail to capture real business impact. We focus on what actually matters: customer acquisition costs, lifetime value, and net profitability.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Transparency in tracking and attribution is non-negotiable. You'll always know exactly how your campaigns are performing against the metrics that truly impact your bottom line.

            <p className="text-lg">
              If your current marketing partners still rely on outdated measures like ROAS, they're positioning you for failure.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              In today's privacy-driven, omnichannel landscape, traditional metrics fall short. They offer a limited perspective and fail to capture the full customer journey or the metrics that truly impact your business growth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Say 'goodbye' to misaligned goals and 'hello' to measurable returns. Our approach aligns your teams, data, and efforts around the metrics that matter most for your business growth.
